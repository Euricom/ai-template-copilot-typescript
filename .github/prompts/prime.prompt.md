> Command for priming the context with core knowledge about your project

# Prime Context 

Use the command `git ls-files` to get an understanding of the project structure.

Start with reading the `copilot-instructions.md` and the `README.md` file if it exists to get an understanding of the project.

Read key files in the src/ directory

> List any additional files that are important to understand the project.

Explain back to me:
- Project structure
- Project purpose and goals
- Key files and their purposes
- Any important dependencies
- Any important configuration files
